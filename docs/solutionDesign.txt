## Solution Design ## 

For the solution, I designed simple functions in order to meet the program specification requirements. In order to open the given input instruction file, I created the function 'readInput' that would open it if the prefix of the given input began with 'http'. I created a function to read the file once opened. The function 'parseFile' would parse the input line by line and use RegEx to determine the coordinates and the instruction what to do with them. Based on these instructions, a particular value would return whether the instructions were to turn off, turn on, or witch the light coordinates. 

I created a class to handle all light functionality, which included a function to create the size of the light grid based on the first line of the input, a function to check whether the coordinates on a line were out of range, a function to change the light based on the instruction value, and a  function to count the lights on in a line after the instruction was applied. Finally, I included a function that read all the arguments in this class and summed the lights on in all the lines, and printed the total number of lights on. Finally, I created an overall main function that would initially read the input from the console and also call the function to print the total number of lights on. Furthermore, I  created an additional program to use unit testing with a test input file  in order to ensure that my functions run as intended.
